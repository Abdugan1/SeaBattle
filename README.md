# SeaBattle

The game was made for educational purposes.

In this class, I tried to use the Abstract base class " Player "and generate the" Player Human "and"PlayerBot" classes from it.
In the end, though a little but looked at how virtual methods work. The PlayerBot class turned out to be very simple, shooting at a random place.
