# SeaBattle

The game was made for educational purposes.

My first experience with multiple classes.
In this game, I also tried to use the Abstract base class "Player" and inherited from it the "PlayerHuman" and "PlayerBot" classes from it.
In the end, though a little but looked at how virtual methods work. The PlayerBot class turned out to be very simple, shooting at a random place.
